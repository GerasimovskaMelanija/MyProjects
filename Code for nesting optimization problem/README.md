# Nesting optimization problem

# Description
This code for nesting optimization problem works only for albano dataset, and this code is only for getting the first layout. <br/>
There is a comparation of two algorithms - the first algorithm usese if-else conditions, and the other uses the phidl library.<br/>
If you want to have the best optimized layout, I suggest you to use Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithm.<br/>

# Libraries
1. Numpy<br/>
2. Pandas<br/>
3. Matplotlib<br/>
4. Shapely<br/>
5. Phidl<br/>

# File Description
1. Albano dataset<br/>
2. Jupyter Notebook - code<br/>

# Notes
The language used in this Notebook is Macedonian.
