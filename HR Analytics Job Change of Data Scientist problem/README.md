# Libraries
To be able to run this notebook, you need to install these libraries:<br/>

Matplotlib<br/>
Math<br/>
Collections<br/>

# Description
This dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists). This dataset was created to understand the factors that lead a person to leave current job. It was used in order to find out who will leave the company, and who will stay. More information about the dataset can be found in the file: HR Analytics problem.tex or on Kaggle.<br/>

# File Description
1. HR Analytics problem.tex - Decription of the dataset (the same as on Kaggle)<br/>
2. Dataset divided on: aug_train.csv and aug_test.csv<br/>
3. aug_test.csv does not include the target. The target is in sample_submission.csv and we saved our results there<br/>
4. Jupyter Notebook, where you can see the code<br/>
5. README Markdown File<br/>

# Results
The results are saved in sample_submission.csv. I have tried Logistic Regression, Boosting, SVM, Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest. After that, I choosed the best model and continue to work with it. <br/>
Logistic Regression : 0.754<br/>
SVM: 0.75<br/>
Random Forest: 0.778<br/>
Boosting: 0.786<br/>
MLP: 0.769<br/>
Boosting algorithm had the highest accuracy.<br/>
